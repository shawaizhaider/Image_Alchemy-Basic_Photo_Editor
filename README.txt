- If the exe file is not being generated by "Run_This_To_Compile.ps1" then it is a possibility that your compiler will be x64-based. 
--> In that case you need to open the files for the x64 compiler, modify this line for yourself, and run it in the terminal:

gcc -o ImageAlchemy.exe Image_Alchemy_Source_Code.c -I "/path/to/header/files" -L "/path/to/library/files" -lFreeImage -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++
